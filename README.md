# My Rusty Advent of Code 2023

My *framework* here is a copy of Christopher Biscardi's
[implementation]( https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code/tree/main/2023/rust)
for a rusty take in 2023.

*Solutions* are mine.

## Compte Rendu

1. Was fun and not hard, tried some `nom`.
2. Quite like 1. - learning more `nom`.
3. Learned iterator things, had the right idea but even my part1 was too buggy
    to get a star.
