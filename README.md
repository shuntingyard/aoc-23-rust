# My Rusty Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„

My *framework* here is a copy of Christopher Biscardi's
[implementation]( https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code/tree/main/2023/rust)
for a rusty take in 2023.

*Solutions* are mine.

## Compte Rendu

1. Was fun and not hard, tried some `nom`.
2. Quite like 1. - learning more `nom`.
3. Learned iterator things, had the right idea but even my part1 was too buggy
    to get a star.
4. Easy and fun again. Most time was spent setting up nom to read cards correctly.
    Modifying part1's iterator constructs to move a BTreeMap into a closure
    for tracking the number of repetitions for each card was a breeze...
5. Mapping seeds to soils to ... locations - was a bit hard.

    - part1: interesting use of Range to do the routing. Used fold_many1 for parsing.
    - part2: skipped

6. Didn't do it. Building blocks for a solution:
    `nom::character::complete::line_ending` and `std::iter::zip`

7. Camel Cards - was real fun and I learned things:

    - part1: Lifetimes (discarded later) and implementation
        of PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord for `Hand`
    - part2: convert BTreeMap to a Vec and sort by (value, key) in decreasing order

8. Haunted Wasteland (10â€™151â€™663â€™816â€™849)

    - part1: a simple automaton to reach the state labeled ZZZ
    - part2: printed cycle lengths to each individual __Z-state from all six
        start states, Ctrl-c; then got prime factors of lengths and (manually)
        calculated the least common multiple.

9. Mirage Maintenance - nothing easier than recursion ðŸ˜Ž

10. Pipe Maze

    - part1: learning to use the `petgraph` crate
        (plus implementing Hash and Eq, thrown away later).
